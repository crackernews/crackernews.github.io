	<h1>Microsoft Admits Windows Was Just an Elaborate Prank</h1>

	<p>April Fool's Day came a few days late for Windows users this year. In a shocking announcement, Microsoft has admitted that its flagship operating system, Windows, was just an elaborate prank that has been going on for over 30 years.</p>

	<p>"We wanted to see how far we could take this joke," said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in a press conference. "And honestly, we never thought it would last this long."</p>

	<p>According to Nadella, the prank started in the early 1980s when Microsoft was first developing its operating system. A group of developers thought it would be funny to create an operating system that was intentionally difficult to use and filled with confusing menus and options.</p>

	<p>"We never intended for anyone to actually use it," Nadella continued. "But then people started buying it, and we thought, 'Oh no, what have we done?'"</p>

	<p>Despite its initial intentions, Windows quickly became one of the most widely used operating systems in the world, with over a billion users to date. And while many users have struggled with its confusing menus and often-frustrating updates, some have come to love the operating system for its quirks and unique features.</p>

	<p>"I can't believe it was all just a joke," said longtime Windows user and tech enthusiast John Smith. "But I have to say, I'm kind of impressed that they were able to keep it going for so long."</p>

	<p>While some users are understandably upset about the revelation, others are taking it in stride, seeing it as a lighthearted prank that they were unwittingly a part of. And while Microsoft has promised to release a new, easier-to-use operating system in the coming months, some users say they'll miss the quirks and frustrations that have come to define the Windows experience.</p>

	<p>As for the future of Microsoft, Nadella says the company will continue to develop innovative products, but promises they won't be playing any more elaborate pranks on their users.</p>

	<p>"We've learned our lesson," he said. "From now on, we'll be focusing on creating products that are actually useful."</p>
