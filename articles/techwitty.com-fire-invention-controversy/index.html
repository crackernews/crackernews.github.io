		<h1>Controversy Erupts as Tech Giant Claims to Have Invented Fire, Despite Evidence to the Contrary</h1>
	</header>
	<main>
		<p>A major tech giant made headlines today by claiming to have invented fire, a discovery that has long been attributed to early humans. The company, which has not yet been named, presented their findings at a press conference this morning, but their claims have been met with skepticism from experts in the field.</p>

		<p>The company's research team reportedly analyzed ancient artifacts and found evidence of a "proto-technology" that they believe could have been used to create fire. They claim that this technology was the precursor to the fire-making techniques that humans eventually developed. However, many experts are unconvinced by the company's findings.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>"It's highly unlikely that a tech company could have discovered something as fundamental as fire before humans did," said Dr. Jane Smith, an archaeologist at a major university. "While it's certainly possible that they found evidence of some kind of primitive technology, it's a big leap to claim that this was the same thing as fire."</p>

		</blockquote>
		<p>The controversy has sparked debate among scholars and the general public alike. Some are calling for more evidence to be presented before making a judgment, while others are outright dismissive of the company's claims.</p>
		<p>Regardless of the outcome, this latest development highlights the ongoing relationship between technology and human history, and raises questions about the limits of innovation and discovery.</p>
