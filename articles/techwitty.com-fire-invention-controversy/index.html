        <h1>Controversy Erupts as Tech Giant Claims to Have Invented Fire, Despite Evidence to the Contrary</h1>

        <p>In a move that has left the scientific community flabbergasted, a major tech giant has claimed to have invented fire, prompting widespread skepticism and controversy. The company's claim, made during a recent product launch event, has been met with a mix of disbelief and outrage, as experts point to the millennia of evidence proving the natural occurrence of fire and its use by early humans.</p>

        <p>During the event, the tech company unveiled a new product that they claim revolutionizes the way humans interact with fire. The announcement was accompanied by a bold statement from the CEO, who declared that their company had "invented fire" and would be patenting the technology. The declaration has ignited a firestorm of controversy, with critics arguing that the claim is not only scientifically inaccurate but also ethically questionable.</p>

        <p>Historically, fire has been documented as a natural phenomenon and a critical tool for human survival. Early humans are believed to have discovered fire around 1-2 million years ago, with evidence suggesting that Homo erectus – an extinct species of human – was the first to harness and control it. Fire played a pivotal role in human evolution, providing warmth, protection, and a means of cooking food.</p>

        <p>Experts have been quick to debunk the tech giant's claim, pointing to the wealth of archaeological and anthropological evidence supporting the natural origins of fire. Critics have also raised concerns about the potential implications of a patent on fire, suggesting that it could set a dangerous precedent for the privatization of natural resources.</p>

        <p>Despite the backlash, the tech company has doubled down on their claims, stating that they have developed a revolutionary method of creating and controlling fire that warrants a patent. They argue that their technology is a significant departure from the traditional methods of producing fire, which
