        <p>By John Doe, Tech Beacon</p>
        <p>In an unprecedented event, five leading tech CEOs have decided to put their coding skills to the test in the ultimate hackathon, with the winner taking home all of the losing companies' employees. The CEOs of Tesla, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook have agreed to participate in the 48-hour hackathon, showcasing their technical prowess and competing for the most valuable prize in the tech industry.</p>

        <p>With the rapid growth of the tech industry and a shortage of skilled workers, recruiting and retaining top talent has become increasingly competitive. This extraordinary hackathon, scheduled for next month, aims to resolve the competition by allowing the winner to amass a vast pool of skilled employees from other tech giants, consequently dominating the industry.</p>

        <p>Each CEO will lead a team of their company's top software engineers, with the goal of creating innovative products or services that will be evaluated by an independent panel of judges. The panel will consist of renowned tech leaders, venture capitalists, and industry experts. The evaluation criteria will include innovation, scalability, market potential, and the ability to disrupt the industry.</p>

        <p>Despite the high stakes, the participating CEOs have expressed excitement and enthusiasm for the challenge. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, tweeted, "Looking forward to the ultimate hackathon. Let the best code win!"</p>

        <p>While the tech community has been buzzing with anticipation for the event, some critics have raised concerns about the potential implications of the hackathon, arguing that it could lead to a single company monopolizing the market and stifling innovation.</p>

        <p>The ultimate hackathon is expected to draw millions of viewers from around the world, as tech enthusiasts eagerly wait to see which CEO will emerge victorious and claim the ultimate prize. The event will be live-streamed on multiple platforms and is set to become one of the most-watched tech events in history.</p>
