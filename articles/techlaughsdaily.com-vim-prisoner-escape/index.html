      <h1>Programmer Trapped in Vim for 5 Years Finally Escapes</h1>

      <p>A programmer who was trapped in Vim, the notoriously difficult-to-use text editor, for five years has finally escaped, according to sources.</p>
      <p>The programmer, whose name has not been released, reportedly became trapped in Vim in 2018 and was unable to exit the program. Despite attempts to escape, the programmer found himself constantly returning to the editor.</p>
      <p>"It was like a nightmare that I couldn't wake up from," the programmer said in a statement. "I would try to exit Vim, but I would always end up back in the editor. It was like being stuck in a never-ending loop."</p>

      <p>Friends and family of the programmer became increasingly concerned as the years went by and the programmer remained trapped in Vim. Some even staged interventions in an attempt to break the spell, but all efforts were in vain.</p>
      <p>Finally, after five long years, the programmer managed to break free from Vim and return to a normal life. Details of the escape have not been released, but sources say that the programmer is now using a different text editor and is much happier.</p>
      <p>The story of the programmer's ordeal has become a cautionary tale among the tech community, warning of the dangers of becoming too reliant on a single tool or program.</p>
